    <h1>Ghetto Genius Universe: Urban Prodigies</h1>
    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      Ghetto Genius artists are often underrepresented due to their life circumstances. Our project aimed to explore
      their unique perspectives on the relationship between hip-hop and art through a series of video interviews.
    </p>
    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>
      We did a series of interviews with various underground artists, and in the process showcased their ideas,
      procedures, and products as it relates to their art and hip-hop.
    </p>
    <h2>Intended Outcomes</h2>
    <p>
      We aimed at making a video series that showcases these artists’ work and also tells their story. It can be a
      source of inspiration for others that may want to follow in their footsteps. As well as exposure for the artists
      we worked with, this series hopes to motivate others to experiment in their own creative ways.
    </p>
    <h2>Probem Statement</h2>
    <p>
      Ghetto Geniuses in our day often find themselves in situations that are lacking in resources. However, this
      scarcity doesn’t hold them back from attempting to implement their artistic vision. How do these artists create
      contemporary hip-hop? How do they innovate in their environments
    </p>
    <h2>Research Methods</h2>
    <p>
      We compiled a large amount of video footage by attending multiple events where we saw hip-hop in action, as well
      as conducting a series of interviews, which we then synthesized into several episodes. In addition to the
      interviews, we also documented the variety of work processes.
    </p>
    <h2>Conclusions</h2>
    <p>
      Talking to, interviewing, and showcasing the artists that we worked with gave us insight into their diverse
      backgrounds. We were able to see their viewpoints of how hip-hop influences their work. Subsequently we saw what
      makes these artists ghetto geniuses. They make the most out of what they have, and use that to create new things
      Along the way, some common themes that appeared were sources of inspiration, innovations they had made, and what
      they felt the future held for their art.
