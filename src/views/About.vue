                Ghetto Genius artists are often underrepresented due to their life circumstances. Our project aimed to
                explore their unique perspectives on the relationship between hip-hop and art through a series of video
                interviews.

                We did a series of interviews with various underground artists, and in the process showcased their
                ideas, procedures, and products as it relates to their art and hip-hop..

              <p class="card-text">
                We aimed at making a video series that showcases these artists’ work and also tells their story. It can
                be a source of inspiration for others that may want to follow in their footsteps. As well as exposure
                for the artists we worked with, this series hopes to motivate others to experiment in their own creative
                ways.

                Ghetto Geniuses in our day often find themselves in situations that are lacking in resources. However,
                this scarcity doesn’t hold them back from attempting to implement their artistic vision. How do these
                artists create contemporary hip-hop? How do they innovate in their environments

              <p class="card-text">
                Talking to, interviewing, and showcasing the artists that we worked with gave us insight into their
                diverse backgrounds. We were able to see their viewpoints of how hip-hop influences their work.
                Subsequently we saw what makes these artists ghetto geniuses. They make the most out of what they have,
                and use that to create new things Along the way, some common themes that appeared were sources of
                inspiration, innovations they had made, and what they felt the future held for their art.
